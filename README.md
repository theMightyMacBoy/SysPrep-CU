# SysPrep-CU
SysPrep Scripts used for a credit union

Place Files in C:\Windows\Setup\ and run EndRun64.bat to begin.  Recommened that you use your own SysPrep.xml file.

Be sure to add the first login commands from my XML to yours... 

The first login scripts will set static IP (with /16 subnet and my dns servers) and then join to domain and put in OU. Replace your stuff as needed.
